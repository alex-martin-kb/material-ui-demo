# Material-UI Demo

## Setup

Simply run `yarn` and `yarn start` as this is just a simple react project utilizing the material ui framework.

This currently just uses the basics of Grids and was a quick setup. There are areas I should've used withStyles to pull information from the theme but I didn't want to spend a ton of time on this and wanted to get quick functionality working and show some basic Grid, Button, Stepper, Select, and Card components.
